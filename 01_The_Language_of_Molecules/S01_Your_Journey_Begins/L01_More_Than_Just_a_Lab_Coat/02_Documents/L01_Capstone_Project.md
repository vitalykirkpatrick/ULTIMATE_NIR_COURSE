# Capstone Project: Assignment 1

### Project Overview

Welcome to the Ultimate NIR Course Capstone Project! Throughout this course, you will work with a single, real-world dataset to build a complete NIR calibration model from start to finish. The project is designed to simulate the entire workflow of a professional NIR analyst.

**The Scenario:** You are an analyst at a large animal feed producer. The company wants to develop an NIR method to measure Protein, Fat, and Moisture in incoming soybean meal. This will allow them to quickly assess the quality of raw materials and adjust their formulations accordingly.

### Your Task for This Lesson

Your first task is not to touch the data or the instrument. Your task is to set up the project for success by establishing the documentation and framework that will ensure data integrity throughout the entire project.

1.  **Create a Project Logbook:**
    -   Create a new document (e.g., a Word document, a Google Doc, or a physical notebook).
    -   This will be your official logbook for the entire project.
    -   On the first page, create a title for the project: "Soybean Meal NIR Calibration Project".
    -   Add today's date and your name.

2.  **Write the Project Objective:**
    -   In your logbook, write a clear and concise objective for the project. It should be a single sentence. For example: "To develop, validate, and deploy a robust NIR calibration model for the routine analysis of Protein, Fat, and Moisture in soybean meal."

3.  **Define the Scope:**
    -   Below the objective, create a section called "Scope".
    -   List the key parameters of the project:
        -   **Material:** Soybean Meal
        -   **Constituents to be Measured:** Protein, Fat, Moisture
        -   **Reference Methods:** (e.g., Kjeldahl for Protein, Soxhlet for Fat, Loss on Drying for Moisture)
        -   **Intended Use:** Routine quality control of incoming raw materials.

4.  **Sign and Date:**
    -   At the bottom of the page, sign and date your entry. This is the first step in creating an **Attributable** and **Contemporaneous** record.

### Deliverable

-   A single-page document that represents the first entry in your project logbook.
-   This document will be the foundation for all future work in the Capstone Project.
