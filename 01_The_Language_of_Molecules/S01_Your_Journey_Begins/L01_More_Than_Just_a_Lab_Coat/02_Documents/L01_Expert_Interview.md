**Interviewer:** Dr. Reed, for someone just starting out, what is the single most common mistake you see new analysts make?

**Dr. Reed:** That’s easy. They trust the instrument too much. They see a green light or a number on a screen and they take it as gospel. They forget that the instrument is just a very sophisticated hammer. It will do exactly what you tell it to do, even if what you tell it is nonsense. The most common mistake is a lack of ownership over the entire process. They see their job as starting when the sample arrives and ending when the result is printed. That’s not the job. The job is to deliver *truth*.

**Interviewer:** That leads into the idea of the analyst as a "bridge." How do you explain that to your teams?

**Dr. Reed:** I tell them that the lab is not an island. It’s the heart of the factory. The data we generate is the lifeblood of the organization. R&D needs our data to develop new products. Production needs our data to control the process in real-time. QA needs our data to release the product. Management needs our data to know if we are making money or losing it. If you don’t understand what each of those departments *does* with your data, you are not an analyst; you are a machine operator. You have to be able to speak their language.

**Interviewer:** You are a big proponent of ALCOA+. Some people see it as just more paperwork. How do you get buy-in?

**Dr. Reed:** I ask them one question: "Do you want to be right, or do you want to be able to *prove* you are right?" Anyone can get a number. A true professional can defend that number in an audit, in a quality investigation, or even in a court of law. ALCOA+ is not paperwork; it’s your professional armor. It’s the chain of custody for the truth. If you can’t prove who did what, when they did it, and that it was done correctly, then your result is just an opinion. And in our business, opinions are very expensive decisions, opinions are worthless.
