# Case Study: The Midnight Delivery

### Background

A large food production facility operates 24/7. At 11:55 PM, a critical shipment of vegetable oil arrives. The production line is scheduled to use this oil in a new batch of product starting at 12:05 AM. A sample of the oil is rushed to the lab with a sticky note that says "TEST ASAP". There is no formal sample submission form or label on the container.

The NIR analyst on duty, Sarah, receives the sample. Her manager calls and says, "We have to start the batch in 5 minutes. Is the oil good to go?"

### The Challenge

Sarah is under immense pressure to provide a fast result. However, she knows that bypassing standard procedures could lead to a catastrophic failure in the production batch, costing the company hundreds of thousands of dollars. She must balance the need for speed with the absolute requirement for data integrity.

### Sarah's Actions

1.  **Refuse to Test (Initially):** Sarah informs her manager that she cannot test an undocumented sample. She explains that doing so would be a major violation of Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) and ALCOA+ principles. She states, "If I test this, the result will be invalid. We have no idea where this sample came from or if it is even the correct material."

2.  **Enforce the Process:** She instructs the production team to follow the standard sample submission process, which includes filling out a digital form that captures the material name, lot number, time of sampling, and the person who took the sample. This creates an **Attributable** and **Contemporaneous** record.

3.  **Document Everything:** While waiting for the official submission, Sarah starts a new entry in her digital logbook. She records the time the sample arrived, its condition (unlabeled), and her communication with her manager. This ensures her actions are **Legible**, **Original**, and **Accurate**.

### The Outcome

The production team quickly completes the digital form. Sarah is now able to proceed with the analysis. The entire process took an extra 10 minutes, but the resulting data was fully compliant and trustworthy. The analysis showed that the oil was out of specification. The batch was stopped, preventing a major quality incident.

### Lessons Learned

- **Process over Panic:** Sticking to the established process, even under pressure, is the only way to ensure data integrity.
- **The Analyst as Gatekeeper:** Sarah acted as the final gatekeeper of quality, preventing a costly mistake.
- **Documentation is Defense:** Her detailed logbook provided a clear audit trail of the event, protecting both her and the company.
