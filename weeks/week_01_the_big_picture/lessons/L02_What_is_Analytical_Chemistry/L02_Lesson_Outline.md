### **Part 3: Main Content Slides (Slides 3-10)**

**Slide 03: The Core Question**
- Lesson title in top-left
- Content: Two fundamental questions
  - WHAT is in this sample? (Qualitative Analysis)
  - HOW MUCH is in this sample? (Quantitative Analysis)
- Visual: Split-screen comparison (cyan vs gold)

**Slide 04: Qualitative vs Quantitative Example**
- Lesson title in top-left
- Content: Real wheat sample example
  - Qualitative: Identifies starch, protein, moisture, oil
  - Quantitative: Measures 12% protein, 14% moisture, 2% oil
- Visual: Realistic wheat samples with lab analysis

**Slide 05: Why It Matters**
- Lesson title in top-left
- Content: Decisions depend on data
  - Grain elevator pricing
  - Dairy quality control
  - Bakery specifications
- Visual: Three realistic industry photos

**Slide 06: Accuracy vs Precision**
- Lesson title in top-left
- Content: Definitions and distinctions
  - Accuracy: How close to TRUE value
  - Precision: How REPEATABLE measurements are
  - You want both
- Visual: Icons/graphics showing concept

**Slide 07: The Bullseye Analogy**
- Lesson title in top-left
- Content: Four scenarios
  - Accurate & Precise (ideal)
  - Precise but not Accurate (needs calibration)
  - Accurate but not Precise (too much variation)
  - Neither (troubleshoot method)
- Visual: Bullseye target diagrams

**Slide 08: Reference Methods**
- Lesson title in top-left
- Content: Established validated procedures
  - Kjeldahl for protein
  - Oven drying for moisture
  - Röse-Gottlieb for fat
  - NIR predicts reference method results
- Visual: Realistic lab equipment photos

**Slide 09: The Reference Method Ceiling**
- Lesson title in top-left
- Content: Critical limitation
  - NIR accuracy ≤ Reference method accuracy
  - Quality of NIR depends on quality of reference data
  - Garbage in = Garbage out
- Visual: Ceiling/limit metaphor with data quality

**Slide 10: Sample Preparation & Method Validation**
- Lesson title in top-left
- Content: Where errors happen
  - Sample prep: grinding, mixing, homogenizing
  - Method validation: proving your method works
  - Both are essential
- Visual: Realistic sample preparation photos

### **Part 4: Lesson Recap Slide (Slide 11)**
**Slide 11: Key Takeaways**
- Lesson title in top-left
- Content: Summary of main points
  1. Analytical chemistry answers WHAT and HOW MUCH
  2. Accuracy and precision are different - you need both
  3. Reference methods set the ceiling for NIR accuracy
  4. Sample preparation and validation are critical
  5. NIR is fast and convenient, but principles don't change
- Visual: Clean summary layout with visual callbacks

### **Part 5: Next Steps Slide (Slide 12)**
**Slide 12: Next Steps - The Story of Spectroscopy**
- Lesson title in top-left
- Content: Preview of Lesson 3
  - How did scientists discover light could analyze matter?
  - The history of spectroscopy
  - From Newton's prism to modern NIR
- Visual: Historical progression visual (prism → spectrum → modern instrument)

## Key Concepts (For Title Slide)

1. **Qualitative vs Quantitative Analysis** - What's there vs how much
2. **Accuracy vs Precision** - True value vs repeatability
3. **Reference Methods & The Reference Method Ceiling** - NIR can't exceed reference accuracy
4. **Sample Preparation Matters** - Where most errors occur
5. **Method Validation** - Proving your method works
