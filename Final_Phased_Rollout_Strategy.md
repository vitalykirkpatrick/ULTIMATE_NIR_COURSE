# Final Phased Rollout Strategy: The "Silent Launch & Retrofit" Model

**Date:** January 12, 2026

## 1. Executive Summary

This document presents the final, recommended strategy for launching the three-tier NIR course system. It addresses the critical challenge of teasing unreleased courses by adopting a **"Silent Launch & Retrofit"** model. This patient, customer-centric approach prioritizes trust and quality, ensuring a sustainable and profitable long-term business model. We will launch each course as a complete, standalone product and only announce subsequent courses after they are built and ready for sale.

## 2. The "Silent Launch & Retrofit" Strategy

### 2.1. Core Principles

-   **No Over-promising:** We will not mention, tease, or allude to any course that is not currently available for purchase. This builds trust and avoids customer frustration.
-   **Launch Complete Products:** Each course (Fundamentals, Professional, Ultimate) will be designed and marketed as a valuable, self-contained learning experience.
-   **Retrofit & Announce:** When a new, higher-tier course is launched, we will update the previous course(s) with simple, non-intrusive announcements informing existing and future students of the new offering.

### 2.2. Phased Rollout Plan

**Phase 1: Launch "NIR Fundamentals"**

-   **Content:** The course is created as a standalone product based on the revised outline below. All teasers are removed.
-   **Marketing:** Marketed as "The best and most comprehensive introduction to NIR spectroscopy available."
-   **Goal:** Establish a strong student base, generate positive reviews, and build a trusted brand.

**Phase 2: Launch "NIR for Professionals" (Est. 6-12 months later)**

-   **Content:** The Professional course is launched.
-   **Retrofit Action:** The final lesson of the Fundamentals course is updated with a video announcement and a link to the new Professional course, offering an exclusive "graduate" discount.
-   **Goal:** Convert a percentage of the existing Fundamentals student base and attract new, more advanced students.

**Phase 3: Launch "Ultimate NIR Mastery" (Est. 12-18 months later)**

-   **Content:** The Ultimate course is launched.
-   **Retrofit Action:** The Professional course is updated with a final announcement lesson. The Fundamentals announcement is updated to show the full learning path (Fundamentals → Professional → Ultimate).
-   **Goal:** Solidify the brand as the definitive, world-leading source for NIR training and maximize lifetime customer value.
