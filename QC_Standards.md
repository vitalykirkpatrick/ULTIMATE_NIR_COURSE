## 1. Guiding Philosophy: Right First Time

Our reputation is built on quality. The purpose of this Quality Control (QC) process is to ensure that every single piece of content we produce is accurate, clear, professional, and effective. We operate on a "Right First Time" principle, using a rigorous, multi-stage review process to catch errors before they ever reach the student.

This system is not about blame; it is about shared ownership of quality. Every team member is a guardian of our standards.

## 2. The QC Checklist: The Four Pillars of Quality

## 3. The QC Workflow: A Multi-Stage Process

No lesson is published without passing through this three-stage workflow.

**Stage 1: Self-Review**
- **Who:** The Content Creator (the person who built the lesson).
- **Action:** The creator must complete a full QC checklist for their own work before submitting it for review. This is the first line of defense.

**Stage 2: Peer Review**
- **Who:** Another qualified team member.
- **Action:** The peer reviewer performs a blind review of the lesson, completing a fresh QC checklist. They provide feedback and may reject the lesson if significant issues are found.

**Stage 3: Final Approval**
- **Who:** The Lead Instructor / Project Owner.
- **Action:** The lead instructor performs the final review, paying special attention to technical accuracy and alignment with the overall course vision. Once they sign off, the lesson is approved for publishing.

## 4. Roles & Responsibilities

- **Content Creator:** Responsible for initial creation and self-review.
- **Peer Reviewer:** Responsible for providing objective, constructive feedback.
- **Lead Instructor:** The ultimate owner of quality, responsible for final sign-off.

This rigorous process ensures that we maintain the highest standards of quality and deliver a world-class learning experience for every student, every time.
