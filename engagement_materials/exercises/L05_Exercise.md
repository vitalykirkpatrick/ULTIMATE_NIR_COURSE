# Lesson 05 Exercise: Interpreting an NIR Spectrum

**Objective:** To practice identifying key features in an NIR spectrum.

---

### **Instructions:**

Below is a hypothetical NIR spectrum of a powdered pharmaceutical sample. The goal is to identify the main components based on the labeled peaks.

**Spectrum:**

(A simplified, hypothetical NIR spectrum would be displayed here as an image, with peaks labeled A, B, and C)

**Peak Information:**

*   **Peak A (around 1450 nm):** A broad peak, characteristic of O-H bonds.
*   **Peak B (around 1700 nm):** A sharp peak, characteristic of C-H bonds in an aromatic ring.
*   **Peak C (around 2100 nm):** A combination band, often associated with cellulose or other polysaccharides.

**Questions:**

1.  Based on Peak A, what common substance is likely present in the sample?
2.  Peak B suggests the presence of what type of chemical structure, often found in active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs)?
3.  Peak C suggests the presence of a common excipient (filler) in tablets. What is a likely candidate for this excipient?
4.  Putting it all together, what are the likely main components of this pharmaceutical powder?
