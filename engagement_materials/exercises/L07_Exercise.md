# Lesson 07 Exercise: Spot the Sampling Error

**Objective:** To identify potential sources of error in sample preparation and presentation.

---

### **Instructions:**

Read the following scenarios and identify the potential source of sampling error in each case.

**Scenario 1:**

A technician is analyzing a batch of whole corn kernels for moisture content. To save time, they scoop a single cup of corn from the very top of a large truckload and analyze it.

*   **Potential Error:**

**Scenario 2:**

A pharmaceutical analyst is measuring the blend uniformity of a powder. They use a glass vial to hold the sample, but they notice that the powder is not packed consistently, with some areas being denser than others.

*   **Potential Error:**

**Scenario 3:**

A food scientist is analyzing a hot, freshly baked batch of cookies for sugar content. They immediately place a hot cookie in the spectrometer for analysis.

*   **Potential Error:**

**Scenario 4:**

A researcher is analyzing a series of liquid samples with different concentrations. They use the same cuvette for each sample but only give it a quick rinse with water between each measurement.

*   **Potential Error:**
