# Lesson 03 Exercise: Wavelength, Frequency, and Energy

**Objective:** To understand and apply the relationship between wavelength, frequency, and energy of light.

---

### **Part 1: Conceptual Questions**

1.  As the wavelength of light increases, what happens to its frequency?
2.  As the frequency of light increases, what happens to its energy?
3.  Which has higher energy: a photon of light in the visible region or a photon of light in the near-infrared region? Explain your answer.

### **Part 2: Calculations**

**Given:**
- Speed of light (c) = 3.00 x 10⁸ m/s
- Planck's constant (h) = 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s

**Calculate the following:**

1.  The frequency (in Hz) of NIR light with a wavelength of 1550 nm.
2.  The energy (in Joules) of a single photon of this light.
