# Week 4 Quiz: Calibration & Validation

**Instructions:** Choose the best answer for each question.

---

**1. What is the primary goal of calibration validation?**

a) To select the most expensive NIR instrument
b) To independently verify that a calibration model meets its intended purpose and provides accurate, reliable predictions
c) To create a visually appealing graph
d) To make the calibration process longer

**2. Which of the following is a key difference between calibration and validation?**

a) Calibration uses a training set, while validation uses an independent test set
b) Validation uses a training set, while calibration uses an independent test set
c) There is no difference; the terms are interchangeable
d) Calibration is performed in the lab, while validation is performed in the field

**3. What does the term "robustness" refer to in the context of an NIR method?**

a) The physical strength of the NIR instrument
b) The ability of the method to remain unaffected by small, deliberate variations in method parameters
c) The speed of the analysis
d) The cost of the instrument

**4. Why is linearity an important characteristic of a calibration model?**

a) It proves the instrument is new
b) It demonstrates that the model's response is directly proportional to the concentration of the analyte over a specific range
c) It ensures the model will work on any instrument
d) It is only important for qualitative models

**5. What are the Limit of Detection (LOD) and Limit of Quantitation (LOQ)?**

a) The maximum concentration a model can predict
b) The smallest concentration of an analyte that can be reliably detected (LOD) and quantified (LOQ) with a certain level of confidence
c) The acceptable range of instrument temperature
d) The time it takes for the instrument to warm up

**6. What is the purpose of a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) in a regulated environment?**

a) To provide suggestions for how to perform a task
b) To ensure that a method is performed consistently and correctly every time, and to provide a basis for training and auditing
c) To list the contact information for the instrument vendor
d) To describe the marketing features of the NIR instrument

**7. Which regulatory body is primarily responsible for overseeing the pharmaceutical industry in the United States?**

a) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
b) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
c) Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
d) Federal Communications Commission (FCC)

**8. What is Process Analytical Technology (PAT)?**

a) A brand of NIR spectrometer
b) A framework for designing, analyzing, and controlling manufacturing processes through timely measurements of critical quality and performance attributes
c) A type of software for processing NIR data
d) A method for cleaning NIR probes

**9. What is the importance of data integrity in a regulated NIR application?**

a) It is a suggestion, but not a requirement
b) It ensures that all data is complete, consistent, and accurate, and has not been altered in an unauthorized manner
c) It only applies to the final prediction results, not the raw data
d) It is only important for academic research, not for industrial applications

**10. Which of the following is a key component of preparing for a regulatory audit?**

a) Hiding any data that looks unusual
b) Ensuring that all documentation is complete, well-organized, and readily accessible
c) Training only one person on how to operate the instrument
d) Deleting all old calibration models
