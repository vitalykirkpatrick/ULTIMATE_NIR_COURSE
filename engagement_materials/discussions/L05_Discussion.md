# Lesson 05 Discussion: The Art and Science of Interpretation

**Prompt:**

Interpreting an NIR spectrum is often described as both an art and a science. It requires scientific knowledge of spectroscopy, but also experience and intuition to recognize patterns and draw conclusions.

*   **In what ways is it similar to interpreting an NIR spectrum?**
