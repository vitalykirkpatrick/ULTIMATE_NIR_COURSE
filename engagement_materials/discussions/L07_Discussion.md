# Lesson 07 Discussion: The "Garbage In, Garbage Out" Principle

**Prompt:**

The phrase "Garbage In, Garbage Out" (GIGO) is often used in computer science and data analysis. It means that the quality of the output is determined by the quality of the input.

*   **How does the GIGO principle apply to NIR spectroscopy, especially in the context of sample preparation?**
*   **Can you share an example from your own experience (in any field) where the quality of the input directly affected the quality of the output?**
