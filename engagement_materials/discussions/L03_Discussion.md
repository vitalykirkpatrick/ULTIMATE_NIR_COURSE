# Lesson 03 Discussion: The Invisible World

**Prompt:**

This lesson explored how light interacts with molecules at a fundamental level. The NIR region of the spectrum is invisible to the human eye, yet it reveals a wealth of information about the chemical world.

*   **What other "invisible" forces or phenomena do we use in our daily lives to understand the world?** (e.g., Wi-Fi, radio waves, magnetism)
*   **How does this compare to the way NIR spectroscopy uses invisible light to "see" the chemical makeup of a sample?**
