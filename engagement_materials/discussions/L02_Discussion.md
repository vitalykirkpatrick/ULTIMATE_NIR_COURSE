# Lesson 2 Discussion: Accuracy vs. Precision

**Prompt:**

This lesson introduced the concepts of accuracy and precision, using the analogy of hitting a bullseye.

*   **Can you think of a real-world example (outside of science/chemistry) where the difference between accuracy and precision is critical?**
*   **In that example, which is more important: accuracy or precision? Or are they equally important?**

Share your example and reasoning with the class.
