# Lesson 1 Discussion: The Power of Light

**Prompt:**

In this lesson, we introduced the concept of using light to understand the chemical world around us. 

Think about a product you use every day (e.g., food, medicine, clothing, fuel). 

*   **How could NIR spectroscopy potentially be used to improve the quality, safety, or production of that product?** 
*   **What specific property would you want to measure?**

Share your thoughts and ideas with your peers!
