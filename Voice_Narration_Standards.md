# NIR Course Production: Voice Narration Standards

**Version 2.1 | Last Updated: January 12, 2026**

---

## 1. Guiding Philosophy: The Voice of Authority

The narration is the core of the student's learning experience. It is the instructor's direct connection to the student. Our voice must be:

- **Clear & Confident:** Speaking with authority and conviction.
- **Conversational & Engaging:** Like a trusted mentor, not a robot reading a script.
- **Purposeful & Concise:** Every word serves a purpose. No filler, no fluff.

This document outlines the **v2.1 Strict System**, which is mandatory for all narration production to ensure consistency and quality.

## 2. The v2.1 Strict System: Core Requirements

This system is designed to create a consistent, high-quality audio experience. Adherence is not optional.

### **Requirement 1: Minimum Word Count**

- **Every narration script must be a minimum of 95 words.**
- **Rationale:** This ensures that each slide has sufficient depth and explanation. It prevents shallow, unhelpful content and forces the creator to add value beyond what is written on the slide.

### **Requirement 2: The Three-Part Script Structure**

Every narration script must follow this structure:

1.  **The Hook (1-2 sentences):**
    - **Purpose:** Grab the student's attention and introduce the slide's core concept.
    - **Example:** "Now that we understand what NIR light is, let's look at how it actually interacts with a sample. This is where the magic really happens."

2.  **The Body (3-5 sentences):**
    - **Purpose:** Explain the main content of the slide in detail. This is where the primary teaching occurs. Add context, explain the "why," and connect the concept to the real world.
    - **Example:** "When NIR light hits a molecule, certain bonds like Carbon-Hydrogen or Oxygen-Hydrogen will start to vibrate and stretch. Think of it like hitting a tuning fork—only specific frequencies will cause it to ring. In the same way, only specific wavelengths of NIR light will be absorbed by these bonds. The spectrometer measures which wavelengths are absorbed and how much, giving us a unique chemical fingerprint of the sample."

3.  **The Bridge (1 sentence):**
    - **Purpose:** Smoothly transition to the next slide.
    - **Example:** "Now that we see how the spectrum is generated, let's look at what a real-world spectrum actually looks like."

## 3. Tone & Delivery

- **Pace:** Speak at a natural, conversational pace. Avoid rushing. Use pauses for emphasis.
- **Enthusiasm:** Sound genuinely interested in the material. Your energy is contagious.
- **Clarity:** Enunciate clearly. Ensure every word is audible and distinct.
- **Confidence:** Speak as the expert you are. Avoid "ums," "ahs," and other filler words.

## 4. Technical Audio Requirements

- **Microphone:** Use a high-quality condenser microphone.
- **Environment:** Record in a quiet, acoustically treated space to eliminate echo and background noise.
- **Format:** Final audio should be delivered in **MP3 format, 192 kbps, 44.1 kHz, Mono.**
- **Processing:** Apply a standard audio processing chain: Noise Reduction -> Normalization (-3dB) -> Compression.

## 5. The "Why" Behind the System

The v2.1 Strict System is not arbitrary. It is designed to:

- **Ensure Depth:** The 95-word minimum forces thoughtful explanation.
- **Create Rhythm:** The Hook/Body/Bridge structure creates a predictable and engaging flow for the student.
- **Guarantee Quality:** The technical standards ensure a professional, distraction-free listening experience.

By adhering to this system, we ensure that every lesson, regardless of who creates it, meets our high standards and delivers a world-class educational experience.
