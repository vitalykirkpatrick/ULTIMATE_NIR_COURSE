# NIR Fundamentals: Engagement & Supplemental Materials Strategy

**Based on Coursera Best Practices for Student Success**

---

## 1. Guiding Philosophy

To create a world-class learning experience, we must go beyond video lectures. This strategy is designed to actively engage students, reinforce learning, and provide practical tools that build both confidence and competence. Our approach follows Coursera's proven model for student success, which emphasizes a regular rhythm of learning and assessment, peer interaction, and hands-on application.

We will use a variety of materials, strategically placed throughout the 8-week course, to cater to different learning styles and keep students motivated.

## 2. The Engagement Toolkit: What We Will Create

Here are the specific types of supplemental and engagement materials we will develop for the **NIR Fundamentals** course:

| Material Type | Description | Purpose | Format |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Practice Quizzes** | Short, 5-question multiple-choice quizzes placed after key lessons. Students get immediate feedback and can retake them multiple times. | **Reinforce & Recall:** Helps students quickly check their understanding of core concepts without the pressure of a grade. | Coursera Quiz Tool |
| **Weekly Graded Quizzes** | More comprehensive 10-question quizzes at the end of each week (Weeks 1-7). These contribute to the final grade. | **Assess & Motivate:** Measures mastery of the week's topics and provides a regular incentive to keep up with the material. | Coursera Quiz Tool |
| **Discussion Prompts** | Open-ended, thought-provoking questions posted in the course forums at the end of specific lessons. | **Reflect & Interact:** Encourages students to think critically, share their experiences, and learn from their peers. Builds a sense of community. | Coursera Forums |
| **Hands-On Worksheets** | Downloadable PDF worksheets that guide students through a practical task, such as interpreting a spectrum or comparing two methods. | **Apply & Practice:** Moves students from passive learning to active problem-solving. These are the most critical for building real skills. | PDF Download |
| **Reference Guides (Cheat Sheets)** | Single-page, beautifully designed PDF documents that summarize critical information. Examples: "Glossary of NIR Terms," "Spectroscopy Family Tree," "NIR vs. Wet Chemistry Comparison Chart." | **Support & Reference:** Provides high-value, quick-reference tools that students can download and keep, extending the value of the course beyond the final lesson. | PDF Download |
| **Final Exam** | A comprehensive, 40-question exam covering all major concepts from the entire course. It is the final requirement for the certificate. | **Synthesize & Validate:** Provides a final, summative assessment of the student's overall knowledge and validates their successful completion of the course. | Coursera Exam Tool |
