## 2. The 10-Step Production Workflow

This workflow takes a lesson from a concept in the course outline to a complete, ready-to-publish package.

### **Phase 1: Content Creation (Steps 1-5)**

- **Output:** A set of WebP image files, one for each slide.

**Step 3: Record & Process the Narration Audio**
- **Input:** The final narration script.
- **Action:** Record the voiceover for each slide.
- **Standard:** Must meet the technical audio requirements in the Voice Narration Standards.
- **Output:** A set of MP3 audio files, one for each slide.

**Step 4: Create the Explanatory Images**

### **Phase 2: Quality Control (Steps 6-8)**

**Step 6: Self-Review**

## 3. The Definition of "Done"

A lesson is not "done" until it has passed all 10 steps of this workflow and has been signed off by the Lead Instructor. This ensures that every single asset we produce is of the highest possible quality and ready to create an exceptional student experience.
