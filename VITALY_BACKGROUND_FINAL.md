## Example Narration Openings

### Using Professional Experience:
> "In my work with food manufacturers, I've seen a common challenge. Quality managers need fast, accurate results. Traditional lab methods take hours. NIR delivers answers in seconds."

### Using Educational Background:
> "My culinary training taught me something important. Food chemistry is all about molecular bonds. C-H bonds. O-H bonds. N-H bonds. NIR measures those exact same bonds."

### Using Client Conversations:
> "Quality managers often ask me the same question. How do we prove our data is reliable? That's where ALCOA+ principles come in."

### Using Plant Observations:
> "During plant visits, I've observed a pattern. The best analysts understand they're not just running tests. They're making decisions that affect the entire operation."
