## 1. Guiding Philosophy: The "Modern Oracle"

Our visual identity is built on the "Modern Oracle" concept. It is designed to be:

- **Authoritative & Trustworthy:** The design feels like a definitive source of truth.
- **Clean & Uncluttered:** The focus is always on the content, with no distracting elements.
- **Visually Rich:** We use high-quality, relevant imagery to explain complex concepts.
- **Consistent:** Every slide, regardless of content, feels like it belongs to the same family.

This is not a flashy, animated, or trendy design. It is timeless, professional, and built for learning.

## 2. Color Palette

The color palette is strict and must be adhered to on all slides.

| Role | Color | HEX Code | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Background** | Deep Navy Blue | `#000033` | The universal background for all slides. |
| **Title Text** | White | `#FFFFFF` | Main titles, headlines, and key callouts. |
| **Body Text** | Light Gray | `#CCCCCC` | Paragraph text, descriptions, and secondary information. |
| **Accent Color** | Bright Yellow | `#FFD700` | Used sparingly for highlights, underlines, key data points in charts, or to draw attention to a specific element. |

## 3. Typography

We use a clean, modern, and highly readable font pairing available on Google Fonts.

| Element | Font Family | Weight | Size (Approx.) | Color |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Main Title** | **Montserrat** | Bold | 64px | White (`#FFFFFF`) |
| **Subtitle** | **Lato** | Regular | 32px | Light Gray (`#CCCCCC`) |
| **Body Text** | **Lato** | Regular | 24px | Light Gray (`#CCCCCC`) |
| **Annotations/Labels** | **Lato** | Italic | 18px | Light Gray (`#CCCCCC`) |

## 4. Layout & Composition

- **The Grid:** All content must align to a simple, invisible grid. Elements should feel intentionally placed, not randomly scattered.
- **White Space (Negative Space):** Do not crowd the slides. Empty space is a powerful tool to guide focus. Leave generous margins around all content.
- **Visual Hierarchy:** The most important element on the slide should be the most visually prominent (usually the main title or a key image).
- **Simplicity:** Each slide should have a single, clear purpose. If a slide tries to do too much, it should be split into two.

---

## 5. Imagery & Graphics

- **Format:** All slide backgrounds are generated as **WebP** files for optimal quality and file size.
- **Style:** Images should be high-quality, professional, and relevant. They must be placed on a **white background** when used as explanatory visuals with text overlays.
- **Purpose:** Images are not decoration. They must serve to explain a concept, show an example, or provide a visual anchor for the topic.
- **Text on Images:** When adding text overlays to explain concepts on an image, use the standard typography (Lato) and ensure there is sufficient contrast for readability.
- **No Watermarks:** All images must be properly licensed and free of watermarks.

## 6. Slide Types & Templates

While the content will vary, we will use a consistent set of slide layouts:

- **Title Slide:** Main course/lesson title, subtitle, and a single, powerful background image.
- **Content Slide (Text Only):** A headline and 2-4 bullet points or a short paragraph. Never more than 50 words total.
- **Content Slide (Text + Image):** An image on one side, with a headline and explanatory text on the other. The image and text should be balanced.
- **Content Slide (Full-Bleed Image):** A high-impact, full-screen image with a single, bold text statement overlaid.
- **Summary Slide:** A concluding slide with the key takeaways from the lesson, presented as 2-3 concise bullet points.

This document serves as the single source of truth for all slide design. Any deviation must be justified and approved.
