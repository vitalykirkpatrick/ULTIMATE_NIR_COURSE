## 1. Executive Summary

*   **Problem:** (A brief, 1-2 sentence description of the business or analytical challenge).
*   **Solution:** (A brief, 1-2 sentence description of how NIR spectroscopy was used to solve the problem).
*   **Results:** (A summary of the key quantitative and qualitative benefits achieved, e.g., cost savings, time savings, improved quality).

---

## 2. The Challenge

(A more detailed description of the problem. What was the previous method? What were its limitations in terms of cost, speed, accuracy, or safety?)

---

## 3. The NIR Solution

*   **Instrument:** (What type of NIR instrument was used? Benchtop, portable, in-line? What was the manufacturer and model, if known?)
*   **Sampling:** (How were the samples collected and presented to the instrument? Diffuse reflectance, transmission, transflectance?)
*   **Model Development:** (A brief overview of the calibration process. How many samples were in the calibration set? What reference method was used? What chemometric model was developed, e.g., PLS?)

## 4. The Results

### **Quantitative Impact**

| Metric | Before NIR | After NIR | Improvement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Analysis Time per Sample** | (e.g., 4 hours) | (e.g., 30 seconds) | (e.g., 99.8% reduction) |
| **Cost per Sample** | (e.g., $50) | (e.g., <$1) | (e.g., >98% reduction) |
| **Product Release Time** | (e.g., 3 days) | (e.g., 1 hour) | (e.g., 98.6% reduction) |
| **Annual Cost Savings** | | | (e.g., $250,000) |

### **Qualitative Impact**

*   **Improved Process Understanding:** (How did real-time data help to better understand and control the process?)
*   **Enhanced Quality:** (How did 100% inspection or faster results lead to higher quality products or reduced risk of out-of-spec material?)
*   **Increased Safety:** (Did NIR replace a hazardous chemical analysis?)
