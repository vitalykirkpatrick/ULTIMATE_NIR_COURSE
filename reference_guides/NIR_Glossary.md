# NIR Spectroscopy Glossary

**A**

*   **Absorbance:** A measure of the quantity of light absorbed by a sample. It is defined as the negative logarithm of the transmittance (A = -log(T)).
*   **Accuracy:** The closeness of a measured value to a standard or known true value.
*   **Analyte:** The substance or chemical constituent that is of interest in an analytical procedure.

**B**

*   **Baseline:** The portion of a spectrum where no significant absorption is occurring. It represents the 100% transmittance or zero absorbance line.
*   **Beer-Lambert Law:** A law stating that the absorbance of a solution is directly proportional to the concentration of the absorbing species and the path length of the light through the solution.
*   **Bias:** A systematic error in a measurement or prediction, causing the mean of a set of results to be offset from the true value.

**C**

*   **Calibration:** The process of developing a mathematical model that relates the NIR spectral response to a known property or concentration of a sample.
*   **Calibration Transfer:** The process of applying a calibration model developed on one instrument to another instrument, or to the same instrument after a significant change.
*   **Chemometrics:** The science of extracting information from chemical systems by data-driven means.
*   **Combination Band:** A spectral band that occurs at a frequency that is the sum of the frequencies of two or more fundamental or overtone vibrations.
*   **Cuvette:** A small, transparent container used for holding liquid samples in a spectrometer.

**D**

*   **Derivative:** A mathematical transformation applied to a spectrum to remove baseline shifts and enhance subtle spectral features. First and second derivatives are common.
*   **Detector:** The component of a spectrometer that measures the intensity of light after it has passed through the sample.
*   **Diffuse Reflectance:** A sampling technique where light that has penetrated the sample and been scattered multiple times is collected and measured.

**F**

*   **FT-NIR (Fourier Transform Near-Infrared):** A type of NIR spectrometer that uses an interferometer and Fourier mathematics to acquire the spectrum, offering high speed and signal-to-noise ratio.

**H**

*   **Hyperspectral Imaging:** A technique that combines digital imaging and spectroscopy to obtain both spatial and spectral information from an object.

**I**

*   **In-line Analysis:** The measurement of a sample directly within a process stream in real-time.

**L**

*   **Linearity:** The ability of a method to elicit test results that are directly proportional to the concentration of the analyte in the sample.

**M**

*   **Mean Centering:** A preprocessing technique where the mean spectrum of the calibration set is subtracted from each individual spectrum.
*   **MLR (Multiple Linear Regression):** A simple regression method that models the relationship between two or more explanatory variables and a response variable by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.
*   **Monochromator:** A device that selects a narrow band of wavelengths of light from a wider range of wavelengths available at the input.

**N**

*   **Noise:** Random, unwanted fluctuations in a signal that can obscure the desired information.

**O**

*   **Outlier:** A sample that deviates significantly from the other samples in a set and may negatively impact the performance of a calibration model.
*   **Overtone:** A spectral band that occurs at a frequency that is an integral multiple of a fundamental vibrational frequency.

**P**

*   **Partial Least Squares (PLS):** A powerful and widely used regression technique in chemometrics that is particularly suited for handling collinear (highly correlated) spectral data.
*   **Path Length:** The distance that light travels through a sample.
*   **PAT (Process Analytical Technology):** A framework for designing, analyzing, and controlling manufacturing through timely measurements of critical quality and performance attributes.
*   **PCA (Principal Component Analysis):** A data reduction technique used to transform a large set of correlated variables into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables called principal components.
*   **Precision:** The degree of agreement among a series of individual measurements when the procedure is applied repeatedly to multiple samplings of a homogeneous sample.

**Q**

*   **Qualitative Analysis:** The identification of the chemical constituents of a substance or mixture.
*   **Quantitative Analysis:** The measurement of the amount or concentration of a chemical constituent.

**R**

*   **Reference Method:** A validated, independent analytical method that provides the "true" values used to build and test a calibration model.
*   **Reflectance:** The ratio of the intensity of reflected light to that of the incident light.
*   **RMSEP (Root Mean Square Error of Prediction):** A common metric for evaluating the predictive performance of a calibration model on an independent validation set.
*   **Robustness:** The ability of an analytical method to remain unaffected by small, deliberate variations in method parameters.

**S**

*   **Scatter:** The phenomenon where light is redirected from its original path due to interactions with particles or inhomogeneities in a sample.
*   **SNV (Standard Normal Variate):** A preprocessing technique used to correct for light scatter effects by normalizing each spectrum.
*   **Spectrometer:** An instrument used to measure the properties of light over a specific portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.
*   **Spectrum:** A plot of the intensity of light as a function of wavelength or frequency.

**T**

*   **Transflectance:** A sampling technique that combines transmission and reflectance, often used for liquids and pastes.
*   **Transmission:** A sampling technique where the light that passes directly through a sample is measured.

**V**

*   **Validation:** The process of demonstrating that an analytical method is suitable for its intended purpose.
