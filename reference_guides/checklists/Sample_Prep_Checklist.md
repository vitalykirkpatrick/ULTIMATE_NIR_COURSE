# Sample Preparation & Presentation Checklist

---

**Objective:** To ensure consistent and high-quality NIR data by following best practices for sample preparation and presentation. A reliable model starts with reliable data.

### **For All Samples**

-   [ ] **Is the sample representative of the entire batch?** (Avoid taking samples from only the top or bottom of a container).
-   [ ] **Is the sample at a consistent and controlled temperature?** (Temperature affects NIR spectra).
-   [ ] **Is the sampling accessory (cuvette, vial, probe) clean and free of residue from previous samples?**
-   [ ] **Is the sample presented to the instrument in a consistent manner every time?**

### **For Solid Samples (Powders, Granules)**

-   [ ] **Is the particle size reasonably consistent?** (Grind or sieve samples if necessary and if it does not alter the property of interest).
-   [ ] **Is the sample packed into the vial or sample cup with a consistent density?** (Avoid air gaps and channeling).
-   [ ] **Is the sample holder filled to a consistent level?**
-   [ ] **For diffuse reflectance, is the sample making good contact with the instrument window or probe tip?**

### **For Liquid Samples**

-   [ ] **Is the sample free of air bubbles?**
-   [ ] **Is the sample free of suspended solids (unless they are part of the analysis)?** (Filter or allow solids to settle if necessary).
-   [ ] **Are you using the correct path length cuvette for the analysis?** (Highly absorbing samples may require a shorter path length).
-   [ ] **Is the cuvette positioned in the instrument in the same orientation for every measurement?**

### **For Slurries and Pastes**

-   [ ] **Is the sample well-mixed and homogeneous?**
-   [ ] **Are you using a sampling accessory designed for viscous materials?**
-   [ ] **Is the sample free of trapped air pockets?**

**Remember the GIGO Principle: Garbage In, Garbage Out.** The time spent on proper sample preparation is one of the best investments you can make in the quality of your NIR results.
