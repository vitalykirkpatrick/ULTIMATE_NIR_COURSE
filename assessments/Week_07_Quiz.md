b) Validating the calibration model with an independent test set
c) Assuming that a calibration model will work perfectly forever without any maintenance
d) Documenting all steps of the method development process

**2. What is the primary purpose of a quality control (QC) program for an NIR instrument?**

a) To make the analysis process more complicated
b) To regularly monitor the instrument's performance and ensure it is operating within specifications
c) To test the knowledge of the instrument operator
d) To increase the number of service calls to the vendor

**3. Which of the following is a key practice for optimizing the efficiency of an NIR workflow?**

a) Performing unnecessary sample preparation steps
b) Automating data collection, analysis, and reporting where possible
c) Storing data in a disorganized manner
d) Using a different calibration model for every sample

**4. Why is good documentation essential in NIR spectroscopy?**

a) It is a good way to use up paper
b) It provides a complete record of the method, ensures traceability, and is critical for regulatory compliance and troubleshooting
c) It is only necessary for academic research
d) It is the sole responsibility of the instrument vendor

**5. Which of the following is a key safety consideration when working with NIR instruments?**

a) The near-infrared light is intensely hot and can cause severe burns
b) The instruments are extremely fragile and will break if touched
c) Following basic electrical safety procedures and being aware of any specific hazards associated with the sample being analyzed
d) The instruments emit high levels of ionizing radiation

**6. What is a key lesson learned from the pharmaceutical case study on raw material identification?**

a) NIR is not a suitable technology for the pharmaceutical industry
b) Portable NIR instruments can be used to rapidly verify the identity of incoming raw materials, preventing mix-ups and ensuring product quality
c) All raw materials look the same in the NIR spectrum
d) The FDA does not approve of the use of NIR

**7. In the food industry case study, how was NIR used to analyze cheese?**

a) To determine the country of origin of the cheese
b) To measure the fat, protein, and moisture content of the cheese in real-time on the production line
c) To count the number of holes in Swiss cheese
d) To determine the age of the cheese

**8. What is a key takeaway from the case studies presented?**

a) NIR is a versatile technology with a wide range of applications across many different industries
b) NIR is only useful for a very small number of specific applications
c) All NIR applications are the same
d) Implementing an NIR solution is always easy and requires no effort

**9. What is the first step in developing your own NIR project charter?**

a) Choosing a software platform
b) Defining the problem you are trying to solve and the specific goals of the project
c) Buying an NIR instrument
d) Collecting thousands of samples

**10. Why is stakeholder management important for a successful NIR project?**

a) It ensures that everyone agrees with you all the time
b) It helps to get buy-in and support from all relevant parties, from management to the operators who will use the system
c) It is a way to blame others if the project fails
d) It is not important; you can do it all yourself
