# Week 3 Quiz: Calibration

**Instructions:** Choose the best answer for each question.

---

**1. What is the primary purpose of building a calibration model in NIR spectroscopy?**

a) To identify the chemical structure of unknown compounds
b) To correlate NIR spectral data with known reference values to predict properties of future samples
c) To measure the wavelength accuracy of the spectrometer
d) To correct for instrument noise and baseline drift

**2. Which of the following is a crucial first step in building a robust calibration model?**

a) Selecting a complex chemometric model
b) Acquiring a large number of random samples
c) Defining the problem and the constituent or property to be measured
d) Applying advanced spectral preprocessing techniques

**3. What is the role of the reference method in NIR calibration?**

a) To provide a secondary, less accurate measurement
b) To provide the "true" values (e.g., concentration, moisture content) that the NIR model will be trained to predict
c) To clean the NIR spectrometer's optics
d) To generate the NIR spectra

**4. Why is it important to have a diverse and representative sample set for calibration?**

a) To make the calibration process more challenging
b) To ensure the model is robust and can accurately predict a wide range of future samples
c) To increase the time it takes to build the model
d) It is not important; any set of samples will work

**5. What is the purpose of a validation set in the calibration process?**

a) To train the calibration model
b) To provide an independent assessment of the model's predictive performance
c) To select the best NIR instrument
d) To determine the wavelength range for the analysis

**6. Which of the following is NOT a common performance metric for evaluating a calibration model?**

a) Root Mean Square Error of Prediction (RMSEP)
b) Coefficient of Determination (R²)
c) Bias
d) Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the instrument

**7. What is calibration transfer?**

a) The process of transferring a calibration model from one instrument to another
b) The process of transferring samples from the lab to the production line
c) The process of transferring data from the spectrometer to a computer
d) The process of transferring knowledge from the instructor to the student

**8. Which of the following is a common challenge in calibration model maintenance?**

a) The model is always perfect and never needs updating
b) The instrument performance never changes over time
c) Changes in raw materials, process conditions, or instrument performance can cause the model's predictions to drift
d) The reference method always provides perfectly accurate values

**9. What is the purpose of outlier detection in calibration?**

a) To include all samples, regardless of their quality
b) To identify and potentially remove samples that are not representative of the main population and could negatively impact the model
c) To make the model less robust
d) To increase the R² value artificially

**10. Which of the following is a key component of good calibration documentation?**

a) Only the final R² value
b) A detailed record of the sample set, reference data, model parameters, and validation results
c) A brief note saying "the model works"
d) The name of the person who built the model
