## 3. Updated Fundamentals Announcement (Post-Ultimate Launch)

**Trigger:** Launch of "Ultimate NIR Mastery" course.

**Action:** The announcement lesson in the Fundamentals course is updated to present a complete learning path.

*   The message will be slightly modified to first introduce the **Professional** course as the logical next step, and then mention the **Ultimate** course as the path to total mastery for those with that ambition.
*   This creates a clear, two-step path for beginners, reducing overwhelm while still presenting the full value ladder.
