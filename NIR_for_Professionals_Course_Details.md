## Course Description

You understand the fundamentals of NIR. You know what it is, how it works, and you’ve seen its potential. But now, it’s time to get your hands dirty. It’s time to move from theory to practice, from understanding to application.

**NIR for Professionals** is the bridge between knowing about NIR and knowing how to *do* NIR. This course is built for the working professional—the QC chemist, the method development scientist, the lab manager, the process engineer—who needs to implement, manage, and get real results from NIR technology. This isn’t about abstract concepts; it’s about the practical skills that solve real-world problems.

We’ll go deep into the entire professional NIR workflow, from designing a robust sample plan to building and validating a bulletproof calibration model. You’ll learn how to troubleshoot failing models, write effective SOPs, and confidently present your results to management. We’ll tackle the tough questions, like how to handle difficult samples, how to choose the right preprocessing, and how to ensure your data is reliable.

This course is packed with case studies, hands-on exercises, and best practices forged from years of real-world experience. By the end of our nine weeks together, you will not just be an NIR user; you will be a competent and confident NIR practitioner, ready to lead projects and make data-driven decisions that add real value to your organization.

If you’re ready to stop just talking about NIR and start making it work for you, this is your course.
